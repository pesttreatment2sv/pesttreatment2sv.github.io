<p>Cover or remove bird cages and aquarium, and relocate other family pets before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Ensure the person who will be using your pesticides holds a legitimate photo ID Pest Control Licence. Consumers must inform the pest exterminators about the specific invasions prior to the treatment or at the time of reservation. Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop prevents access to required food and the beetles will starve.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the most safe for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of a whole area. Due to any number of reasons, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents often permits potential pest organisms to experience essentially uncontrolled population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
