<p>We got 195 mention of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are attracted to a number of locations that can offer any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all three. If many of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be utilized as the last hope, in concept, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of specific endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from typical and consistent pest problems.</p>
