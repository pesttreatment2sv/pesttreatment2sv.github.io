<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" developed over a duration of about 10 years, generally amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are frequently monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which develops a homogenous habitat frequently lacking essential requirements of natural opponents, hence preferring pest types.</p>
<p>A technique that includes using pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through standard breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that minimize the plant's beauty or suitability for the pest to feed, establish, or recreate successfully.</p>
<p>A personalized post-construction and pre-construction service to control or avoid the attack from termites. The historical and more common use of this term is limited to use of natural opponents to handle populations of pest organisms.

<p>Thus IPM is finest combination of all possible methods in pest management with least reliance on chemical pesticide. Management decisions should be based on tracking and population levels of insect pests, in addition to trusted limits. IPM addresses all the financial, environmental, and social aspects and supplies safe and affordable food to the revenues and customers to producers and sellers, while maintaining ecological health.</p>
