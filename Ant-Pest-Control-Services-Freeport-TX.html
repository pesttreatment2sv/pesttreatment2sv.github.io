Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
