<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Regulation on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are needed to think about the principles of IPM prior to using chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of managing pests such as insects and termites by using other organisms 8 It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, but normally also includes an active human management function.</p>
<p>All nations acknowledged IPM as a preferable method to pest control even if it was not widely adopted.
