A recent IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) identified a lack of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both contemporary and standard tools.</p>

You can opt for natural chemical treatments, with botanic or fermented products used to eliminate pests. A resistant range may be less chosen by the insect pest, adversely affect its typical development and survival, or the plant might endure the damage without a financial loss in yield or quality.</p>
