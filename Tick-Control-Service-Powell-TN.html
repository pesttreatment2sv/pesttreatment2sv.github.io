<p>IPM (incorporated pest management) primarily includes approaches used to avoid plant problems from taking place in the very first place. In addition to establishing clear signs that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is also required to offer criteria to determine performance of the system.

Public need is affected by retail marketing methods, concerns for food security based upon pesticide regulations in their region, and a lack of knowledge on food production to name a few aspects.</p>
